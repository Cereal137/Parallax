This is a self-built code for Astrometric Parallax in Python 3.9

The basic model is from the Hipparcos Catalogue (ESA 1997, Vol. 1 & Vol. 3)

The AstrometricTemplate.py is intended to clarify the celestial coordinates and some operations

The SampleClass.py and the WLS.py are used to fit the data in a more managable way

Feel free to contact if you get confused or find something needed to be improved.

Many Thanks! Peace.
